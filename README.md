# Custom-Flight-Manager

This is a simple yet clear flight manager application for your trips.

## How to open the APP

First, you need to setup the Python environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can start the server:
```bash
streamlit run main.py  
```

Finally, your own database will be created and updated during using the APP.


## Something to further improve
- [ ] Change the overlapping routes into arcs
- [ ] Directly import the data from existing apps (e.g., 纵横航旅) conveniently
